##  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bassim
Iâ€™m an open source developer obsessed with building bulletproof tools that feel effortless to use.

### ðŸ”­ **What I'm working on**
I'm building [`react-shiki`](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/react-shiki/), a fast and flexible client-focused syntax highlighter for React. It provides a clean component API like [`react-syntax-highlighter`](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter), alongside a more flexible React hook, bringing the modern, powerful [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) syntax highlighter to React in an elegant and intuitive package.

Iâ€™m also a Founding Engineer at [`assistant-ui`](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui), where weâ€™re raising the bar for developer experience (DX) and accessibility in AI chat. Itâ€™s a powerful SDK paired with a shadcn-style UI library, giving you everything you need to spin up an advanced, type-safe chat app with best-in-class design, accessibility, and performance. From a production-grade app in minutes to the most advanced workflows you can imagine, assistant-ui covers the full spectrum with a clean, composable API and exceptional DX.
