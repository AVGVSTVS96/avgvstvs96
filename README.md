##  🤖 Hi, I'm Bassim, an IT Professional from New York
### ⚡ **Interests**
I have a wide range of interests and hobbies including 3D printing and design, drone building and flying, marketing, photography, investing, PC hardware, cars and racing, sim racing, and gaming, in addition to programming. I'm also an avid student of history, philosophy, and political science.

### 🔭 **What I'm working on**
I'm currently working on the third version of my personal blog/portfolio website built with Astro and TailwindCSS - [astroSite](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/astroSite/). The [second version](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/v2-site/) of my personal website is deployed at [bassimshahidy.com](https://bassimshahidy.com) and is also built with Astro and TailwindCSS, although it's a much simpler single page site that I built when I started learning web development. I'm also experimenting with shadcn/ui and react in [astro-shadcn](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/astro-shadcn/).

### 🌱 **What I'm learning**
I'm currently learning technologies like Astro, React, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

### 🖥️ **What I've built**
[FastGPT](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/fastGPT/), a lightweight FastAPI based OpenAI GPT3.5/4 chat bot with features like streaming, system message customization, markdown, and syntax highlighting. I also have a Flask version called [flaskGPT](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/flaskGPT/), and attempted a React version called [reactGPT](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/reactGPT/), although reactGPT has some bugs because I've only just started delving into the world of JavaScript frameworks.
