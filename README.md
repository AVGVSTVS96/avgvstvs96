##  🤖 Hi, I'm Bassim, an IT Professional from New York
- ⚡ **Interests:** I have a wide range of interests and hobbies including 3D printing and design, drone building and flying, marketing, photography, investing, PC hardware, cars and racing, sim racing, gaming, and programming, of course! I'm also an avid student of history, philosophy, and political science.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** the third version of my personal blog/portfolio website built with Astro and TailwindCSS - [astroSite](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/astroSite/).

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** web development with technologies like Astro, React, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

- 📄 **My plan:** my current goal as I learn web development is to make at least one meaningful change/addition to my projects every day. I want to ensure that I continue making progress in my web development journey, implementing new methods and technologies in my projects as I learn.

- 🖥️ **I built:** [FastGPT](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/fastGPT/), a lightweight FastAPI based OpenAI GPT3.5/4 chat bot with features like streaming, system message customization, markdown, and syntax highlighting. I also have a Flask version called [flaskGPT](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/flaskGPT/), and attempted a React version called [reactGPT](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/reactGPT/), although reactGPT has some bugs because I've only just started delving into the world of JavaScript frameworks.
