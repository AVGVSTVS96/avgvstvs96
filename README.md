##  🤖 Hi, I'm Bassim, an IT Professional and Software Engineer from New York

### ⚡ **Interests**
I have a passion for programming and web development, alongside a wide range of interests and hobbies including 3D printing/design, drone building/flying, photography, cars and racing, sim racing, and gaming. I'm also an avid student of history, philosophy, and political science.

### 🔭 **What I'm working on**
I'm currently building [`react-shiki`](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/react-shiki/) a Shiki based syntax highlighter for React. It's goal is to serve as a more modern and performant [`react-syntax-highlighter`](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter) replacement, with a similar component API and an emphasis on performance.

### 🖥️ **What I've built**
My first project as I started to learn how to program was [`flaskGPT`](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/flaskGPT/), an OpenAI GPT3.5/4 chat bot with features like streaming, system message customization, markdown, and syntax highlighting. I then converted it to [`FastGPT`](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/fastGPT/), and experimented with a [React version](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/reactGPT/).

More recently, I've nearly completed my portfolio website [`astroSite`](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/astroSite/) which includes a much more refined GPT chat interface, blog, and a couple more playground pages. This portfolio site is a sandbox where I experiment and build new features, learning as I continue to improve and add to it.

Through working on my portfolio site, I built [`react-shiki`](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/react-shiki/), and  [`astro-fouc-killer`](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/astro-fouc-killer/), a basic integration to eliminate flash of unstyled content (FOUC) with light/dark modes.
